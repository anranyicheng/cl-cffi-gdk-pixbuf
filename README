cl-cffi-gdk-pixbuf is a Lisp binding to the image loading GdkPixbuf library.

This library is loaded from the cl-cffi-gtk3 library for a Lisp binding to
GTK 3 and the cl-cffi-gtk4 library for a Lisp binding to GTK 4.

The cl-cffi-gdk-pixbuf library was part of the cl-cffi-gtk library and was
separated out to be used independently. The former cl-cffi-gtk library is
replaced with the cl-cffi-gtk3 for GTK 3 and the cl-cffi-gtk4 library for GTK 4.
